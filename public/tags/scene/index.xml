Whilst acknowledging the benefits of Intercultural Bilingual Education, Webb and Radcliffe criticise the way in which this has been implemented. The current focus on assimilation of Mapuche individuals into “Chilean society” does not take into account the very different historical experiences between Mapuche communities and those of European descent in Chile, and ignores the impact that this has on social, economic and educational opportunities.</description></item><item><title>Article 1: Paddlepacking</title><link>http://annahrichards.com/post/chapter-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Apr 2017 10:58:08 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://annahrichards.com/post/chapter-1/</guid><description>Despite the obvious limitations of writing about Mapuche experiences solely within the boundaries of an imposed nation-state, this essay focuses on Mapuche activism and experiences solely within Chile. Mapuche communities exist in areas across Argentina and Chile, and the recognition of their geographic location within these state boundaries is not intended to recognise or legitimise their power over Wallmapu, only to allow a more in depth analysis of Mapuche protest movements within a more limited region.</description></item></channel></rss>
