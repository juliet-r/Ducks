Whilst acknowledging the benefits of Intercultural Bilingual Education, Webb and Radcliffe criticise the way in which this has been implemented. The current focus on assimilation of Mapuche individuals into “Chilean society” does not take into account the very different historical experiences between Mapuche communities and those of European descent in Chile, and ignores the impact that this has on social, economic and educational opportunities.</description></item><item><title>Article 5</title><link>http://annahrichards.com/post/chapter-5/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Apr 2017 11:15:58 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://annahrichards.com/post/chapter-5/</guid><description>In 2000, the Chilean government introduced Intercultural Bilingual Education, which recognised the need for Mapuche histories and knowledge to be taught and promoted within the official curriculum and educational system.

Mapuche communities exist in areas across Argentina and Chile, and the recognition of their geographic location within these state boundaries is not intended to recognise or legitimise their power over Wallmapu, only to allow a more in depth analysis of Mapuche protest movements within a more limited region.</description></item></channel></rss>
