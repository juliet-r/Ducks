    <h1> My favourite ducks</h1>
    <p>There are many beautiful kinds of duck in the world, here are some of my favourites</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The wandering whistling duck
            <p>This is my all time favourite kind of duck because it both wanders, and whistles. They're very good swimmers and when they are not wandering or whistling they like to dive in lagoons.</p>
            <p>1100/10 absolutely perfect</p>
            <p><img src="/static/whistling.jpg" alt=""></p>
        </li>
        <li>Mallards
            <p>This is a very common kind of duck in the UK and one that you are very likely to spot around <a href="/static/places/"> Edinburgh</a>. They have also been introduced in many Latin American countries as well as New Zealand and Australia so are true citizens of the world.</p>
            <p>10/10 very good duck</p>
            <p><img src="/static/mallard.jpg" alt=""></p>
        </li>
        <li>Welsh Harlequin
            <p>The Welsh Harlequin is a beautiful duck who comes from Wales and has a nice round body.</p>
            <p>10/10 good job welsh harlequins!</p>
            <p><img src="/static/harlequin.jpg" alt=""></p>
        </li>
        <li>Yellow-billed duck
            <p>Lovely yellow bills as the name suggests. They live in Southern and East Africa and are very sociable, they like to dabble for food together in groups </p>
            <p>11/10 very nice very friendly</p>
            <p><img src="/static/yellow.jpg" alt=""></p>
        </li>
        <li>Coot
            <p>Not a duck!!! ALthough they like to hang around with ducks and are just as lovely, coots do not count as ducks.</p>
            <p>still 9/10 for their duck-like flair</p>
